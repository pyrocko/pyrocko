### Added
- Squirrel:
  - `squirrel jackseis`: new command line options: `--traversal`, `--tinc`
- Fomosto QSEIS backend: added support for qseis_2006b with adjustable source
  disk radius. Setting this to zero allows calculating of seismograms which are
  correct for low frequencies down to static displacement.

  - Seismosizer: add single-force source model.
  - Smartplot integration for improved MPL plot/figure layouting.
  - New built-in Snuffling: Spectrogram

- Default antialising FIR filter ``fir-remez`` now uses 45 x q taps instead of
  40 x q.

### Fixed
- *Important:* fixed buffer overflow error in `pyrocko.util.time_to_str`. This
  one-byte buffer overflow occurred for time formats, when the format string
  did *not* request fractional seconds to be appended, e.g. `'%Y-%m-%d
  %H:%M:%S'`. It caused random crashes on macOS and, for longer format strings,
  also on Linux. The error did not occur with the default `format` parameter of
  `time_to_str`.
- Squirrel: various bug fixes and minor improvements.
- Automap: improved GMT6 support.

  - STA/LTA: fix error where markers were being inserted multiple times.
  - Fix Snuffler crashes when exception is raised in trigger button calls.
- Much improved `pyrocko.plot.smartplot` module.
- Corrected conversion between volume-change and moment for VLVD and explosion
  sources. Before, the approximation for a Poisson solid was used.

  solutions for displacement and dislocation modelling.
- New extension `modelling.ext.okada_ext` following `Okada, 1992` to calculate
  displacements and spatial derivatives.

  extension and inverter to estimate dislocation based on stress drop on a
  rectangular rupture plane.

  based on `modelling.okada.OkadaSource` combined with the Eikonal solver to
  perform quasi-dynamic slip modelling.
- New plotting module for the `PseudoDynamicRupture` in `plot.dynamic_rupture`.
- New scenario `scenario.sources.pseudodynrupture` for usage of the
  `PseudoDynamicRupture` as `colosseo` input.
- New `aggressive_oversampling` attribute for both `gf.RectangularSource` and
  `gf.PseudoDynamicRupture` allowing for hard oversampling of the basesources.

  button, more options).

### Added
- Reading of GNSS location information from datacube files.
- Jackseis: added possibility to restitute data to displacement, velocity, or
  acceleration.

### Fixed

  (macOS).

  (affects grondown scripts).

## v2021.06.29

### Added
- Windows support (experimental).
- Jackseis: can now use 3-digit Julian day in output filename templates.

### Changed
- Snuffler: improved fidelity when working with many markers. It should now be
  possible to smoothly handle 100.000 markers. The option
  `--disable-marker-sorting` can be supplied to disable sorting in the marker
  side-panel for an additional speedup.
- Improved high precision (HP) time handling. Pyrocko now has two distinct
  modes for time handling. Timestamps are now handled either as 64-bit floats
  or as 96/128-bit floats. The mode can be selected by environment variable,
  config setting or by a call to `util.use_high_precicion_time` at program
  startup. HP time mode is only available on platforms where NumPy's HP floats
  are available. HP time mode is necessary when handling data with sampling
  rates above 100 kHz.
- Dropping support for Python 2 binary distribution packages (Anaconda and
  PIP).
- Python 2 support will be removed from Pyrocko in the near future in order to
  reduce our maintenance and testing workload. Sorry.

  `quantity='velocity'` was selected in a `pyrocko.gf.Target` with a GF store
  with `stored_quantity='displacement'`. The returned amplitudes were incorrect
  except for the case of 1 Hz GFs.

### Changed
- Installation of prerequisites is now possible with a separate script
  `install_prerequisites.py` rather than through `setup.py
  install_prerequisites`.
