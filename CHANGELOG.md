# Changelog

All notable changes to Pyrocko are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## Unreleased

### Added

- Squirrel:
  - `squirrel jackseis`: new command line options: `--traversal`, `--tinc`
- Fomosto QSEIS backend: added support for qseis_2006b with adjustable source
  disk radius. Setting this to zero allows calculating of seismograms which are
  correct for low frequencies down to static displacement.
- Snufflings:
  - Seismosizer: add single-force source model.
  - Smartplot integration for improved MPL plot/figure layouting.
  - New built-in Snuffling: Spectrogram
- Docs: add mini-tutorial on how to set up and use remote Snuffler through VNC.
- New function to get a Snuffler-like time axis in MPL plots
  `pyrocko.plot.mpl_time_axis`
- Convenience script for Windows users to download and install MSVC build tools
  15 from the command line.
- Pseudo-dynamic rupture model: add method to get centroid location.

### Changed
- Squirrel: refactored Channel and Sensor classes, improved channel-to-sensor
  logic.
- Snuffler: enlarged default filter ranges.
- Reimplemented TypeC (3D) GF store. To my knowledge this store type has not
  yet been used in the wild, so felt free to improve the design.

### Fixed
- *Important:* fixed buffer overflow error in `pyrocko.util.time_to_str`. This
  one-byte buffer overflow occurred for time formats, when the format string
  did *not* request fractional seconds to be appended, e.g. `'%Y-%m-%d
  %H:%M:%S'`. It caused random crashes on macOS and, for longer format strings,
  also on Linux. The error did not occur with the default `format` parameter of
  `time_to_str`.
- Squirrel: various bug fixes and minor improvements.
- Automap: improved GMT6 support.
- Fix crash in `pyrocko.trace.degapper` with `fillmethod='zeros'`.
- Fix output channel naming in `pyrocko.trace.rotate_to_rt`.
- Snuffler:
  - Now always uses locale-independent dates in time axis.
  - Various appearance fixes.
  - Prevent a confusing warning at startup on macOS.
- Snufflings:
  - STA/LTA: fix error where markers were being inserted multiple times.
  - Fix Snuffler crashes when exception is raised in trigger button calls.
- Much improved `pyrocko.plot.smartplot` module.

- New module `modelling.cracksol` containing different analytical crack
  solutions for displacement and dislocation modelling.
- New extension `modelling.ext.okada_ext` following `Okada, 1992` to calculate
  displacements and spatial derivatives.
- New module `modelling.okada` with `OkadaSource` object as wrapper of C
  extension and inverter to estimate dislocation based on stress drop on a
  rectangular rupture plane.
- New `gf.seismosizer.PseudoDynamicRupture` wrapping boundary element method
  based on `modelling.okada.OkadaSource` combined with the Eikonal solver to
  perform quasi-dynamic slip modelling.
- New plotting module for the `PseudoDynamicRupture` in `plot.dynamic_rupture`.
- New scenario `scenario.sources.pseudodynrupture` for usage of the
  `PseudoDynamicRupture` as `colosseo` input.
- New `aggressive_oversampling` attribute for both `gf.RectangularSource` and
  `gf.PseudoDynamicRupture` allowing for hard oversampling of the basesources.
- RMS Snuffling: Option to show log RMS.
- New example on how to create QuakeML files from scratch.

  StationXML.

- Drop support for Qt4.
- Improvements to directivity plot.
- Renamed Snuffling "Block RMS" to "RMS".
- Fomosto QSEIS backend can now handle non-zero (negative) top layer depth,
  e.g. for models including the atmosphere.
- Removed support for initial marker file format from before August 2011.
- New installation recommendations.
- Snuffler: two more marker kinds/colors (6, 7).
- Snuffler: migrated from right-click menu to regular menubar.

## v2021.09.14

### Changed
- Improved RMS and STA/LTA Snufflings (keep responsive while processing, abort
  button, more options).

### Added
- Reading of GNSS location information from datacube files.
- Jackseis: added possibility to restitute data to displacement, velocity, or
  acceleration.

### Fixed
- Fix problems with Station-XML files containing 1900-01-01 dummy dates
  (macOS).
- Correct 'pyrocko-python' symlink on Linux which was broken in v2021.06.29
  (affects grondown scripts).

## v2021.06.29

### Added
- Windows support (experimental).
- Jackseis: can now use 3-digit Julian day in output filename templates.

### Changed
- Snuffler: improved fidelity when working with many markers. It should now be
  possible to smoothly handle 100.000 markers. The option
  `--disable-marker-sorting` can be supplied to disable sorting in the marker
  side-panel for an additional speedup.
- Improved high precision (HP) time handling. Pyrocko now has two distinct
  modes for time handling. Timestamps are now handled either as 64-bit floats
  or as 96/128-bit floats. The mode can be selected by environment variable,
  config setting or by a call to `util.use_high_precicion_time` at program
  startup. HP time mode is only available on platforms where NumPy's HP floats
  are available. HP time mode is necessary when handling data with sampling
  rates above 100 kHz.
- Dropping support for Python 2 binary distribution packages (Anaconda and
  PIP).
- Python 2 support will be removed from Pyrocko in the near future in order to
  reduce our maintenance and testing workload. Sorry.

  sub-sources.

## v2021.04.02

### Added

  traveltimes relatively.

  directivity effects for synthetics.

  compression changed to STEIM2.
- YAML files can now include other YAML files, when loaded through guts.
- Moment tensor objects can now also be initialized from east-north-up
  coordinates.

### Fixed

  fixes some accuracy issues, regarding the spacial sampling interval.

  window.

## v2020.10.26

### Fixed

  NumPy/Python3.8.

### Changed

  `True`, to be consistent with the behaviour before the introduction of that
  flag.

  seismogram synthesis in `pyrocko.gf`. The problem occured when
  `quantity='velocity'` was selected in a `pyrocko.gf.Target` with a GF store
  with `stored_quantity='displacement'`. The returned amplitudes were incorrect
  except for the case of 1 Hz GFs.

### Changed
- Installation of prerequisites is now possible with a separate script
  `install_prerequisites.py` rather than through `setup.py
  install_prerequisites`.

## v2020.08.18
