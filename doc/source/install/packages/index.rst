Python package manager installations
------------------------------------

We provide pre-compiled Anaconda and pip packages for use with Python 3,
running on X86_64 Linux, Mac OS X and Windows. As a fallback for other systems
and platforms we provide pip source packages which are compiled during
installation with pip.
