Python package manager installations
------------------------------------

We have pre-built packages ready for Anaconda3 running on Linux64 and Mac OS X.
If you want to keep using Anaconda2 you have to build Pyrocko from source. For
the ``pip`` package manager, we have source packages ready, meaning Pyrocko is
built on your system during the installation:
