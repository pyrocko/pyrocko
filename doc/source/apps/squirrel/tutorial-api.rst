Squirrel API usage
==================

.. _squirrel_cli_example:

A complete example: calculate hourly RMS values
-----------------------------------------------

In this tutorial we will write a user-friendly command line interface (CLI)
program to calculate hourly root-mean-square (RMS) values for continuous
seismic waveform recordings. Many methods in seismology process waveform
recordings in similar ways and so this example can serve as a design pattern
for tools creating daily spectrograms, PSD plots or drum plots, earthquake
detectors, automatic pickers, and so on. We will show different styles of
writing such a script/app, each useful in slightly different situations. If you
use the provided building blocks and follow the conventions laid out below,
your app will immediately feel familiar to other Squirrel users. And it will
ship with a bunch of nice features, like support for extra large datasets. And
it will be pleasure to maintain.

**Specs for the tutorial app:**

- Calculate hourly RMS values.
- Get data from local file collection or from online FDSN web services.
- Keep and reuse downloaded raw data (don't download same data twice).
- Process a given time span.
- Station/channel selection.
- Efficiently hop through the data in chunks of one hour
- Always start chunks at full hour.
- Bandpass filter data before calculating RMS.
- Extinguish filter artifacts by use of overlapping time windows.

.. _squirrel_quick_and_dirty:

Variant 1: quick and dirty script
.................................

Feel like hard-coding today? Sometimes we do not need any sophisticated CLI or
configuration files.

Here's a commented solution to the RMS calculation task. Study carefully -
there is a lot of functionality packed into this short script.

.. literalinclude :: /../../examples/squirrel_rms1.py
    :caption: :download:`squirrel_rms1.py </../../examples/squirrel_rms1.py>`
    :language: python

.. note::

   In the code above, we have shown three different ways of restricting the
   channels to be processed. Each of these narrows down the set of channels
   available but they have very different effects:

   - The ``query_args`` argument of :py:meth:`sq.add_fdsn()
     <pyrocko.squirrel.base.Squirrel.add_fdsn>` restricts the meta-data known
     to Squirrel by limiting what is fetched from the `FDSN station web service
     <https://www.fdsn.org/webservices/fdsnws-station-1.1.pdf>`_. Using
     ``query_args`` has the benefit of reducing the size of the meta-data to
     transmit and parse. However changing it later will result in new queries
     to be made. If unchanged, the locally cached meta-data will be used when
     the program is rerun.
   - By calling :py:meth:`sq.update_waveform_promises()
     <pyrocko.squirrel.base.Squirrel.update_waveform_promises>` we give
     Squirrel permission to download certain waveforms by creating so-called
     *waveform promises* for matching channels and time intervals. If we call
     the method without specifying the ``codes`` argument, waveforms from all
     stations/channels are marked as downloadable. Squirrel will not download
     anything if we do not call :py:meth:`sq.update_waveform_promises()
     <pyrocko.squirrel.base.Squirrel.update_waveform_promises>`.
   - The ``codes`` argument of :py:meth:`sq.chopper_waveforms()
     <pyrocko.squirrel.base.Squirrel.chopper_waveforms>` selects from the
     waveforms we have locally and from the `waveform promises` set up earlier.
     Downloading will happen just as needed and in chunks of reasonable size.

Before we actually run the script we will first create a local Squirrel
environment, so that all the downloaded files as well as the database are
stored in the current directory under :file:`.squirrel/`. This will make it
easier to clean up when we are done (``rm -rf .squirrel/``). If we omit this
step, the user's global Squirrel environment
(:file:`~/.pyrocko/cache/squirrel/`) is used.

Create local environment (optional):

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ squirrel init

And now let's run our script:

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ python squirrel_rms1.py
    [...]
    squirrel_rms1.py:psq.client.fdsn - INFO - FDSN "bgr" metadata: querying...
    squirrel_rms1.py:psq.client.fdsn - INFO - FDSN "bgr" metadata: new (expires: never)

Excellent! It is downloading waveform data and calculating RMS values.

The lines with the RMS values are printed to *stdout*, while log messages go to
*stderr*. Like this, we could for example redirect only the RMS results to a
file but still see the log messages in the terminal:

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ python squirrel_rms1.py > rms-GR.BFO..LHZ.txt

Running the script a second time is way faster, because nothing has to be
downloaded.

Not very flexible though with all the hard-coded settings in the script. Read
on to see how we can configure data access from the command line.

Variant 2: basic CLI app
........................

Instead of hard-coding the data sources in the script, we could set them with
command line arguments. The :py:mod:`pyrocko.squirrel.tool` module offers
functionality to set up our program so that it accepts the same options and
arguments like for example ``squirrel scan``. Here's the complete program after
changing it to use :py:class:`~pyrocko.squirrel.tool.SquirrelArgumentParser`:

.. literalinclude :: /../../examples/squirrel_rms2.py
    :caption: :download:`squirrel_rms2.py </../../examples/squirrel_rms2.py>` - Notable differences to :ref:`Variant 1 <squirrel_quick_and_dirty>` highlighted.
    :language: python
    :emphasize-lines: 17-27

:py:class:`~pyrocko.squirrel.tool.SquirrelArgumentParser` inherits from
:py:class:`argparse.ArgumentParser` from the Python Standard Library but has a
few extra features useful when working with squirrels.

.. note::

    It is also possible to add Squirrel's standard CLI options to the standard
    :py:class:`argparse.ArgumentParser`. This may be useful when extending an
    existing app. An example is provided in :download:`squirrel_rms4.py
    </../../examples/squirrel_rms4.py>`.

To get RMS values of some local data in the directory ``data/2022``, we could
now run

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ python squirrel_rms2.py --add data/2022

The tool is also self-documenting (``--help``):

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ python squirrel_rms2.py --help
    usage: squirrel_rms2.py [--help] [--loglevel LEVEL] [--progress DEST]
                        [--add PATH [PATH ...]] [--include REGEX]
                        [--exclude REGEX] [--optimistic] [--format FORMAT]
                        [--add-only KINDS] [--persistent NAME] [--update]
                        [--dataset FILE]

    Report hourly RMS values.

    General options:
      --help, -h            Show this help message and exit.
      --loglevel LEVEL      Set logger level. Choices: critical, error, warning,
                            info, debug. Default: info.
      --progress DEST       Set how progress status is reported. Choices: terminal,
                            log, off. Default: terminal.

    Data collection options:
      --add PATH [PATH ...], -a PATH [PATH ...]
                            Add files and directories with waveforms, metadata and
                            events. Content is indexed and added to the temporary
                            (default) or persistent (see --persistent) data
                            selection.

    [...]

      --dataset FILE, -d FILE
                            Add files, directories and remote sources from dataset
                            description file. This option can be repeated to add
                            multiple datasets. Run `squirrel template` to obtain
                            examples of dataset description files.

So, to use a remote data source we can create a dataset description file and
pass this to ``--dataset``. Examples of such dataset description files are
provided by the ``squirrel template`` command. By chance there already is an
example for accessing all LH channels from BGR's FDSN web service! We can save
the example dataset description file with

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ squirrel template bgr-gr-lh.dataset -w
    squirrel:psq.cli.template - INFO - File written: bgr-gr-lh.dataset.yaml

The dataset description is a nicely commented YAML file and we could modify it
to our liking.

.. code-block:: yaml
    :caption: bgr-gr-lh.dataset.yaml

    --- !squirrel.Dataset

    # All file paths given below are treated relative to the location of this
    # configuration file. Here we may give a common prefix. For example, if the
    # configuration file is in the sub-directory 'PROJECT/config/', set it to '..'
    # so that all paths are relative to 'PROJECT/'.
    path_prefix: '.'

    # Data sources to be added (LocalData, FDSNSource, CatalogSource, ...)
    sources:
    - !squirrel.FDSNSource

      # URL or alias of FDSN site.
      site: bgr

      # FDSN query arguments to make metadata queries.
      # See http://www.fdsn.org/webservices/fdsnws-station-1.1.pdf
      # Time span arguments should not be added here, because they are handled
      # automatically by Squirrel.
      query_args:
        network: 'GR'
        channel: 'LH?'

Expert users can get a non-commented version of the file by adding ``--format
brief`` to the ``squirrel template`` command.

To calculate RMS values for the configured dataset, we can now run

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ python squirrel_rms2.py --dataset bgr-gr-lh.dataset.yaml
    [...]
    GR.BFO..LHZ. 2022-01-14 00:00:00.000 1663.1710971934713
    GR.BFO..LHZ. 2022-01-14 01:00:00.000 1773.5581525847992
    GR.BFO..LHZ. 2022-01-14 02:00:00.000 1688.5986175096787
    [...]

This is a bit more flexible because we can now easily exchange the data used
from the command line. But there is still room for improvements. Read on to see
how we can create a nicely structured program supporting multiple subcommands.

.. _squirrel_cli_tight_single:


Variant 3: structured CLI app
.............................

In this next iteration of our example RMS app, we will:

- Improve the program structure by the use of
  :py:class:`~pyrocko.squirrel.tool.SquirrelCommand` and :py:func:`squirrel.run
  <pyrocko.squirrel.tool.run>`. This will also enable catching certain
  exceptions and reporting failure conditions in a consistent way.
- Add options to select the channels and time spans to be processed
  (``--codes``, ``--tmin``, ``--tmax``)
- Add options to select the filter range (``--fmin``, ``--fmax``).
- Support multiple subcommands: ``./squirrel_rms3.py rms`` will report the RMS
  values just like before and ``./squirrel_rms3.py plot`` is there to plot the
  RMS values as a function of time. The latter is left unimplemented as an
  exercise for the reader.

For each subcommand we want to support, we will create a subclass of
:py:class:`~pyrocko.squirrel.tool.SquirrelCommand` and overload the methods
:py:meth:`~pyrocko.squirrel.tool.SquirrelCommand.make_subparser`,
:py:meth:`~pyrocko.squirrel.tool.SquirrelCommand.setup`, and
:py:meth:`~pyrocko.squirrel.tool.SquirrelCommand.run`.  The name and
description of the subcommand is configured in
:py:meth:`~pyrocko.squirrel.tool.SquirrelCommand.make_subparser`. In
:py:meth:`~pyrocko.squirrel.tool.SquirrelCommand.setup`, we can configure the
parser and add custom arguments.
:py:meth:`~pyrocko.squirrel.tool.SquirrelCommand.run` will be called after
command line arguments have been processed. Finally, we put everything together
with a single call to :py:func:`squirrel.run <pyrocko.squirrel.tool.run>`. This
will process arguments and dispatch to the appropriate subcommand's ``run()``
or print a help message if no subcommand is selected.

Here's the final implementation of the RMS tool:

.. literalinclude :: /../../examples/squirrel_rms3.py
    :caption: :download:`squirrel_rms3.py </../../examples/squirrel_rms3.py>`
    :language: python

.. note::

    If we do not need multiple subcommands, we can still use the same structure
    of our program. We can pass a single
    :py:class:`~pyrocko.squirrel.tool.SquirrelCommand` to the ``command``
    argument of :py:func:`squirrel.run <pyrocko.squirrel.tool.run>`::

        squirrel.run(
            command=PlotRMSTool(),
            description='Report hourly RMS values.')
