Fomosto tutorial
================

Fomosto is a tool to help create and work with pre-calculated and stored
Green's functions.

Introduction
------------

Many seismological methods require knowledge of Green's functions in dependance
of ranges of source and receiver coordinates. Examples range from synthetic
seismogram calculation over source imaging techniques to source inversion
methods.  Calculation of Green's functions is a computationally expensive
operation and it can be of advantage to calculate them in advance. The same
Green's function traces can then be reused several or many times as required in
a typical application.

Regarding Green's function creation as an independent step in a use-case's
processing chain encourages the storage of these in an application independant form.
They can then immediatly be reused when new data is to be processed, they can
be shared between different applications and they can also be passed to other
researchers, allowing them to focus on their own application rather then
spending days of work to get their Green's function setup ready.

Furthermore, it is useful to store associated meta information, like e.g.
travel time tables for seismic phases and the earth model used, together with
the Green's function in order to have a complete and consistent framework to
play with.

Pyrocko contains a flexible framework to store and work with pre-calculated
Green's functions. It is implemented in the :py:mod:`pyrocko.gf` subpackage.
Also included, is a powerful front end tool to create, inspect, and manipulate
Green's function stores: the :program:`fomosto` tool ("*forward model storage
tool*").

Invocation and online help
--------------------------

Fomosto is a command line program. A brief help overview is shown, when it is
started without any arguments.

.. highlight:: console

::

    $ fomosto
    Usage: fomosto <subcommand> <arguments> ... [options]

    Subcommands:

        init          create a new empty GF store

        report        report for Green's function databases,

    To get further help and a list of available options for any subcommand run:

        fomosto <subcommand> --help

The first argument selects the subcommand. All other arguments and options are
dependant on the subcommand. Options start with a double dash, as in
``--option``. If an option takes an argument, it must immediatly follow the
option, as in ``--option=argument``.

Creating a new Green's function store
-------------------------------------

Fomosto does not do the actual computation of the Green's functions. A separate
Green's function modelling code is required to do this.

However, Fomosto provides a unified interface to configure and run these codes
in order to make it simple to build a database of pre-calculated Green's
functions.

Four modelling codes, including Python interfaces required for Fomosto are
hosted in the Pyrocko code repository:

 - https://git.pyrocko.org/pyrocko/fomosto-qssp
 - https://git.pyrocko.org/pyrocko/fomosto-qseis
 - https://git.pyrocko.org/pyrocko/fomosto-qseis2d
 - https://git.pyrocko.org/pyrocko/fomosto-psgrn-pscmp

For detailled information regarding each computation code refer to the
Downloads/Software website of section 2.1 (GFZ): https://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/section/physics-of-earthquakes-and-volcanoes/infrastructure/tool-development-lab.
Green's function stores calculated with QSSP and QSEIS can be used for dynamic waveform and static displacement modeling. Green's functions stores which are created with the PSGRN-PSCMP backend return step functions and are therefore mostly applicable to static displacement
modeling.
Installation is done for each code inside the uncompressed folder by (More information in each packages' :file:`README.md`):

.. code-block :: bash
    :caption: Installation example for ``qseis``

    autoreconf -i   # only if 'configure' script is missing
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

In this example, we will use QSEIS as the modelling code.

To initialize an empty Green's function store to be built with QSEIS 2006a run::

    $ fomosto init qseis.2006a my_first_gfs

to use a different backend, e.g. QSSP 2010, run::

    $ fomosto init qssp.2010 my_first_gfs

A directory named ``my_first_gfs``, containing some example configuration files
is created::

    my_first_gfs/
    |-- config       # (1)
    `-- extra/
        `-- qseis    # (2)


The file ``config`` (1) contains general settings and the file ``extra/qseis``
(2) contains extra settings which are specific to the QSEIS modelling code.
These files are in the `YAML <http://yaml.org/>`_ format, which is a good
compromise between human and computer readability. The contents of the
configuration files are disussed in the next section.  The default
configuration produced by the ``fomosto init`` command can be used without any
modifications for a quick functional test.

First step is to create tabulated phase arrivals::

    $ cd my_first_gfs
    $ fomosto ttt
    ...
    $ ls phases/
    begin.phase  end.phase  p.phase  P.phase  s.phase  S.phase

These tabulated phase arrivals are later, in the *build* step, used to cut the
generated Green's function traces before insertion into the database.

Now, we can calculate the Green's function traces::

    $ fomosto build

Green's functions are built in parallel, if possible. The number of worker processes
may be limited with the ``--nworkers=N`` option.

We now have a complete Green's function store, ready to be used. This is the
directory structure of the store:

.. code-block :: text
    :caption: Green's function store directory structure

    my_first_gfs/         # this directory represents the GF store
    |-- config            # general settings
    |-- decimated/        # directory for decimated variants of the store
    |-- extra/            # any extra meta information is in here
    |   `-- qseis         # e.g. parameters used for the initial modelling
    |-- index             # index part of the storage
    |-- phases/           # tabulated phase arrivals are looked for in here
    |   |-- begin.phase
    |   |-- end.phase
    |   |-- p.phase
    |   |-- P.phase
    |   |-- s.phase
    |   `-- S.phase
    `-- traces            # big binary file with the actual GF data samples

We may now want to change some configuration values and rebuild the Green's
functions.

.. note::

    The syntax for the timings in the ``time_region`` and ``cut`` in the above
    example configuration is described in :py:class:`pyrocko.gf.meta.Timing`.

If configuration values have been changed, it may be neccessary to rebuild the
tabulated phase arrivals or the Green's functions. By default, Fomosto will
refuse to overwrite any GF store content. Use the ``--force`` option to override
this behaviour::

    $ fomosto ttt --force
    $ fomosto build --force

When debugging problems with the GF modelling setup, it can be helpful to
increase the verbosity of the program::

    $ fomosto build --loglevel=debug --nworkers=1

This will show in more detail, e.g. what input is generated for the modelling
code.

Considerations for real-world applications
------------------------------------------

A Green's function store of type A (:py:class:`pyrocko.gf.meta.ConfigTypeA`)
contains precalculated Green's functions on a grid for combinations of source
depth *z* and source-receiver surface distance *x*. How many Green's functions
to calculate in advance is determined by the use-case. The depth range to be
calculated is given by the earthquake source depths to be studied. The distance
range by the smallest and largest distances between possible source points and
receiver positions. How dense the grid has to be made depends on whether we
want to be able to later interpolate the Green's function between neighboring
nodes (a requirement for the analysis of extended sources) or if we don't have
such a requirement. For bilinear interpolation to work fine, it is neccessary
to make the grid dense enough, so that no aliasing effects can occur. This
means that the grid spacing *dx* should be (considerably) smaller than *v_min /
f_max*, where *v_min* is the slowest apparent velocity of the seismic waves at
the surface and *f_max* is the highest frequency to be analysed. For example if
we want to study waveforms in a frequency range of up to 2 Hz and the slowest
horizontal velocities are 2 km/s, we need a grid spacing well below 1 km so we
may try with 250 m. The Green's functions should be calculated with a temporal
sampling rate of at least 4 Hz in this example, better more.

Typically there is some trial and error involved in determining a stable and
efficient set of parameters for a new modelling setup. The strategy is to first
do some trial runs with a sparse grid and/or with a lowered sampling rate until
we get a feeling for the modelling parameters. The final run for a dense grid,
may take days or even weeks of computation time and we don’t want to waste that
effort.

Diagnostics
-----------

To quickly visualize selected Green's function traces use Fomosto's *view*
subcommand.  Run the following command to show the Green's function traces for
ten equally spaced distances::

    $ fomosto view --extract='20k,@10'

If we are not in the Green's function store's directory, we can equally use::

    $ fomosto view --extract='20k,@10' path/to/my_first_gfs

The extracted traces are shown in a Snuffler window, labeled as ``<counter>
(<source-depth>, <distance>) <component>``.

.. figure:: /static/fomosto_view_1.png
    :align: center

It is also possible to directly compare the traces of two (or more) different
Green's function stores. As a demonstration, here we created two Green's
function stores, one using QSEIS for the modelling (``qseis-test``), the other
using QSSP (``qssp-test``). The example configurations produced by ``fomosto
init ...`` have been used, only the sampling rate has been changed to 1 Hz in
both.  To compare some traces of the two Green's function stores append both
their directory names to the view command::

    $ fomosto view qseis-test qssp-test --extract='20k,@5'

Rearranging the view in Snuffler a bit, we can quickly spot some differences:

.. figure:: /static/fomosto_view_2.png
    :align: center

Here we can see, that at the closest distance, the QSEIS trace (red) contains a
final static offset, while the QSSP trace (blue) does not.

Other diagnostic subcommands are ``fomosto tttview`` to visualize the travel
time tables, ``fomosto stats`` to summarize some technical details, and
``fomosto check`` which checks the store for *NaN* values and some other
problems.

.. _fomosto_report:

Report subcommand
-----------------

The report subcommand will create a pdf document containing an artefacts report, displacement seismograms, velocity seismograms (optional), maximum amplitude graphs for seismograms, spectrum graphs, earth model graphs and the contents of the Green's function configuration file.  Each set of seismograms will contain five graphs with increasing amplitude scales.  To view the subcommands of report, it can be ran without any arguments from the command line.

Here is a minimal configuration file (to be used with the ``fomosto report single`` command).  If wanting to use the ``fomosto report double`` command, just copy/paste the entire contents below the existing contents, and change only the ``store_dir`` path.  To see a full configuration file, use the ``output`` option on any of the ``fomosto report`` subcommands.

This configuration file will create four sets of seismograms (source1-sensors1, source1-sensor-2, ...), but if you only specific source-sensor array combinations, then use the optional parameter ``trace_configs`` like::

    trace_configs:
    - [source1, sensors2]
    - [source2, sensors1]

placed at the bottom of the configuration file.  This will only produce the seismograms for the listed combinations.

.. highlight:: console

To try the configuration file, save to your home directory as ``min_config``.  Make sure you have the specified Green's function store accessible.  Then run::

    $ fomosto report single ~/min_config

and you will create a pdf file called ``iceland_reg_v2_0.25-0.5Hz.pdf`` in your home directory.  If you want to see what an output configuration file looks like::

    $ fomosto report single ~/min_config --output=~/min_config_full

Creating decimated variants of a Green's function store
-------------------------------------------------------

For some applications, it can be useful if the sampling rate of the Green's
functions are variable; for example if the method first analyses the lower
frequency content of the signal and in a later stage refines the results
including higher frequencies or if the frequency range to be analysed is
dependant on the magnitude of the source. Because a lower sampling rate typically
also means that the Green's functions are required on a less dense spacial grid,
this can lead to less computational effort and lower memory consumption of the
application.

We can create downsampled variants of a Green's function store with the
``fomosto decimate`` command. For example, running

::

    $ fomosto decimate 2
    $ fomosto decimate 4

in a store directory creates variants of the database with half and a quater of
the original sampling rate. The downsampled variants are stored in the
``decimated`` subdirectory of the store, so we can again compare the traces
with

::

    $ fomosto view . decimated/2 decimated/4 --extract='@2,@5'

If not only the temporal but also the spacial
sampling should be reduced, a modified configuration for the downsampled
variants can be used::

    $ cp config config.2.temp
    $ # edit config2.temp; e.g. double the distance_delta value
    $ fomosto decimate 2 --config=config.2.temp
    $ rm config.2.temp

How to combine or split Green's function stores
-----------------------------------------------

Sometimes, it is neccessary to combine or split Green's function stores. For
example if we want to extend an existing store with more additional source
depths, or if we wish to extract a subset of an existing database.  This is
done with Fomosto by creating an empty target store with the desired extents
and by then copying the relevant traces from the source stores to the target
store.

1) Create empty copy of ``my_first_gfs``::

        $ fomosto init redeploy my_first_gfs derived

2) Adjust parameters in ``derived/config``; e.g. change the extents of the
   store.

3) Copy traces from ``my_first_gfs`` to ``derived``. Only traces at
   nodes which are present in both stores are copied.

   ::

      $ fomosto redeploy my_first_gfs derived
